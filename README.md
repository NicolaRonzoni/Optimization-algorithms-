# Conjugate Method: a benchmark in the neighbourhood of the minimum in a convex quadratic function- 
To run the code .ipynb the following step are necessary:
1. Have installed python3.
2. Having access to Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda or from Colab.

The code uses basic libraries such as: math, scipy, pandas and numpy. 
In addition for the visulization of the plot and images matplotlib, mpl_toolkits should be installed.

The code is organized in the following section: 

1. Definition of the function quadratic function , visualization in a 3d plot. 
2. Definition of a function for the Conjugate Method algorithm. 
3. Definition of a function for the Descent Gradient algorithm. 
4. Definition of a function for the Newton's Method  algorithm. 
5. Definition of a function to visualize the different trajectories of the algorithms in the neighbourhood of the minimum. 
6. Experiment 2 for loops for the creation of the samples and the computation of the test.
7. Analysis of the samples created.
